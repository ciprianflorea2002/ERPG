Inspiration
Online learning becomes more common due to the current pandemic, but it is hard to keep students engaged in learning. Teachers reported it is not uncommon that students skip classes or missed assignments.

In light of this, we would like to make remote learning fun and enjoyable by creating an assessment platform with gamification components.

A multiple-choice test will be given in the form of a simple dungeon crawler to make it fun. The app also includes other gamification components such as scores and a leader board.

What it does

Features

Teachers can create a game by completing a form in the 'Create Game' Tab. A game consists of 12 questions. Each question comes with a difficulty, 1 correct answer and 3 wrong ones. Each game must have 6 easy questions (difficulty between 1-4), 3 medium questions (5-7) and 3 hard questions (8-10).

Adding the test in the 'Create Game' tab generates a code and students can use the code given by their teachers to join a game.

On the 'Play Game' page, students can play a game by typing the code of the game and choosing their username.

In this dungeon-style game, the ultimate goal is to defeat the boss of the map by answering questions. The player starts with 3 lives. Upon exploring the map, the player will encounter mobs (which have 1 life) and, at the end, one final boss (which has 3 lives). The mobs can be defeated by answering a question correctly, but be careful - every wrong answer you give removes 1 life! To defeat the boss you will have to answer 3 questions correctly, which will come in increasing difficulty.

All game scores, calculated by both the accuracy of answers and speed of completion, will be recorded. Players will be shown on the leader board for recognition. 

How we built it
Challenges we ran into
Most of our team members had no experience in unity and web development, we spent a lot of time watching tutorials and debugging.

Accomplishments that we're proud of
We have completed the UI design and game development.

What we learned
We learnt a lot about using Unity to make games.
