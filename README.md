Inspiration

Online learning becomes more common due to the current pandemic, but it is hard to keep students engaged in learning. Teachers reported it is not uncommon that students skip classes or missed assignments.

In light of this, we would like to make remote learning fun and enjoyable by creating an assessment platform with gamification components.

The multiple choice test will be given in the form of a dungeon crawler to make it fun. The app also includes other gamification components such as scores and a leader board.

What it does

Features

Students can use the code given by their teachers to join a game by choosing a username.

The dungeon is the default mode for assignments, in which users will need to explore the map and defeat multiple mobs by answering questions. A mob is defeated when the player manages to answer a question correctly. To win the game they have to defeat the boss of the map which requires the player to answer 3 questions correctly with increasing difficulty. The player has only 3 lives and each incorrect answer removes 1 life. A mob has 1 life, while the boss has 3.

All game scores, calculated by both the accuracy of answers and speed of completion, will be recorded. The players will be shown on the leader board for recognition.
